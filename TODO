Just some random ideas I had...

keypress callbacks to allow actuators to respond to keypresses
	- allow more than 1 callback per key?
	- allow xmms.c to hook into it and pass the keys back
	to xmms

have a throttle in the config to allow for mass-disabling of
actuators based on a 'speed rating' they are given (hard coded by
developer)

Add support for parallelizable actuators

Actuator groups

Add outputting default options values to pndoc

Write MMX-enabled versions of apply_xform, blur_exec

Ideas for actuators:
	A container that cycles through or randomly switches
		bewteen its containees - also have it add a
		keyboard hook for letting the user trigger a
		switch (either random or cycling)
	An actuator that executes a .pna file - how to handle
		recursion - a can't call list?

There's a bug causing a segfault when the window is resized to
	be very small... FIX IT ;)

Allow actuators to have a 'prepare' function that can be called
incrementally or when the window is resized
